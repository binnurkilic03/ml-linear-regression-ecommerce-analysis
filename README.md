# Linear Regression Analysis for E-commerce Customer Data

## Project Overview

This project involves a predictive analysis to assist an online clothing retailer, Amazon_cloths, in deciding whether to prioritize enhancing the mobile app experience or improving the website. The analysis is based on customer data provided in a CSV file, which includes fictitious credit card numbers and email addresses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **linear_regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and linear regression model.
- **ecommerce_customers.csv**: Dataset containing customer information.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Data Analysis
The dataset includes the following columns: Email, Address, Avatar, Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership, Yearly Amount Spent

The analysis involves:
Data Loading and Inspection: The dataset is loaded and inspected for null values, data types, and the number of rows and columns.

Data Visualization: Joint plots are created to visualize the relationship between different features, such as 'Time on App' and 'Yearly Amount Spent'.

Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model is built to predict the yearly amount spent by customers based on their behavior on the website and app.


## Results

The analysis provides insights into customer behavior and helps in making data-driven decisions regarding the enhancement of the mobile app or website. The linear regression model can predict the yearly amount spent by customers, which can be used to prioritize improvements.
